# Starting the game

The game consists of a single jar file by the name <code>AM24-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>. It can be found in the deliveries directory.

This file holds both the Server, the CLI and the GUI applications, one of which can be selected when booting.

To run the jar file, use the command

<code>java -jar AM24-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>

from the command line in the jar's folder.


## Server

The machine running the server must be reachable from the clients in order to play the game. To start the server, select the <code>0</code> option when booting.

When launching this command, the server asks if you want to use the default port, that is <code>1234</code>, to listen for incoming messages from the clients, otherwise is possible to choose a port between
<code>1024</code> and <code>65535</code>.

## Client

The CLI and GUI versions of the client can be run by selecting the <code>1</code> option when booting, then is asked which interface the client wants to use,
<code>0</code> in order to use the CLI or <code>1</code> in order to use the GUI.

**WARNING**: For the best CLI experience, we suggest using a native linux terminal, on Windows to have the best experience is suggested to run the command <code>chcp 65001</code> 
on the cmd before running the jar, that guarantees the view of the unicode symbol (This step isn't needed if you use the batch file).
The terminal should run in fullscreen mode or maximized window mode. If these requirements are not met we cannot ensure a high quality CLI experience.

## Command Line Arguments

The command utilized to run the application <code>java -jar AM24-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code> can be followed by these arguments:
- **-s**: followed by the desired port number between 1024 and 65535 as argument, that represents the port
on which the server will be launched;
- **-c**: followed by the ip address of the server and the port on which the server is listening, to start a client using the CLI;
- **-g**: to start a client using the GUI (no further info needed).

# Windows

For windows are available <code>.bat</code> file in order to boot faster the application:
- Server.bat that launch the server on the default port (the Server.txt used to create this bat).
- Cli.bat that launch a client with CLI on localhost and default port with the code that guarantees the view of the Unicode symbol (the Cli.txt used to create this bat).
- Gui.bat that launch a client with GUI (the Gui.txt used to create this bat).

All this file must be added to the same directory of the jar, or can be added the path in the first line after the keyword <code>cd </code> or following the instructions
of Eriantys.txt. 
<!-- inserire i bat-->
